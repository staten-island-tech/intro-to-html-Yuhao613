    <h1>About Me Project</h1>
    <h2>Yuhao Huang</h2>
    <p>My birthday is on March 25th. My height is 4'11 and weighs 151 pounds. My blood type is B. I never took any computer science classes. I eat the school lunch even though it upsets my stomach. One time I got lost in the middle of Miller Field because it was so dark. I often sleep right when I get home; then when I wake up at like 8 to 9 PM, I start crashing out since I thought it's the morning.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Volleyball</li>
        <li>8 Ball</li>
        <li>Video Games</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fun fact about me:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Seagulls pooped on me twice</li>
        <li>I spent $3,000 on food monthly</li>
        <li>I have a 500 losing streak on word hunt</li>
    </ol>
